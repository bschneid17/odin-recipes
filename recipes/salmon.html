            <h2>The Recipe</h2>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 (3 ounce) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
                        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon finely minced garlic</li>
                        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                        <li>½ lemon, sliced</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Pour flour in a bowl and dredge salmon, shaking off the excess.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook salmon fillets until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.</li>
                        <li>Pour wine into the skillet and scrape browned bits from the bottom. Add garlic and cook until garlic is fragrant and slightly brown and liquid is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers. Bring to a boil while stirring. Stir in butter until melted. Return salmon fillets to skillet and spoon sauce over them.</li>
                        <li>Cook, turning fillets once, until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes. Serve salmon with sauce poured over it and garnish with lemon slices.</li>
                    </ol>
